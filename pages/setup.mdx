# Getting Setup for Git
These instructions may be deceptively short.  They link out to github documentation.

## Installing Git
To get started for working with Git in this class please make sure that you have Git Installed on your machine:
- Window Users: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-windows
- Mac Users: comes out of the box!

## Setup Username and Email for Git
So that you are ready to make commits you should set your email and name.  They will be used to mark commits as being done by you!
- Setting Up User Name [here]https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git
- Setting Up Email [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)
## Github
If you don't already have one go to github.com and signup for an account using your Akamai email.  Don't worry they are free!

After that set up an SSH key following the instructions for Mac or Windows [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)



## What about GUI tools for working with Git? 
From personal experience, I can say that using visual tools for VCS is seductive to start, but can make it hard to understand the core conecepts. Starting with the git command line tool allows you to quickly get the core concepts without the overhead of one UI's understanding of git.  It also forces you enter commands and take a more active action in them instead of banging on random buttons hoping for the correct effect (again personal experience).
